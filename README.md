# plume-creator
Software for writers

This software is the continuation of Plume Creator from http://sourceforge.net/projects/plume-creator/

The main change is the coding language : python 3.4 / PyQt5 instead of the c++ / Qt5 of the original software.

To avoid confusion with version numbers, this new Plume will start at version 1.5.0 . To point out the sofware is still under development, all releases will be tagged "alpha" until the 2.0 release.

Of course, the projects from the old Plume will be importable.

Help in testing or coding is always welcome !

## For developers 



You must set up the workspace before beginning to develop Plume.
Add to your environnmeent variables :

PLUME_DEVELOP_FROM=/path/to/plume/source/code

### In linux :
export PLUME_DEVELOP_FROM=/home/[username]/Devel/workspace_eclipse/plume-creator

#### Necessities :

sudo apt-get install pyqt5-dev-tools

sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5

sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5.qtsql

sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5.qtopengl

Python 3 needs a few modules to launch Plume properly

In a terminal :
